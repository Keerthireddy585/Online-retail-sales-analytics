# Online Retail Sales Analysis (SQL & Dashboard)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a **relational database** for an online retail system and performing **SQL-based descriptive analysis** to evaluate sales performance, customer contribution, and order behavior.  
It demonstrates end-to-end use of SQL for **data modeling, analysis, and reporting**.

> **Note:** Dataset contains limited records; dashboards focus on demonstrating data modeling, SQL analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Database Design
- Designed a **normalized relational database schema** to model end-to-end retail transactions
- Implemented **primary and foreign key constraints** to maintain data integrity
- Created structured tables for:
  - Customers
  - Categories
  - Products
  - Orders
  - Order Details
  - Payments

## SQL Analysis & Implementation
- Wrote **SQL queries** to analyze:
  - Sales performance by category and time period
  - Order cancellations and revenue impact
  - Customer spending and lifetime value
- Created **SQL views** for reusable category-level sales analysis
- Implemented **stored procedures** for dynamic retrieval of top customers
- Used joins, aggregations, subqueries, and date-based grouping

## Descriptive Analysis
Performed descriptive analysis to:
- Identify **high-contributing customers** based on total spending
- Determine **top-performing products and categories**
- Analyze **order status patterns**, including cancellations
- Understand **key drivers behind order cancellations and revenue variation**

## Data Visualization
- Visualized:
  - Revenue distribution across categories
  - Category-wise and product-level performance
  - Customer contribution to total revenue
- Built dashboards to improve **performance visibility and business insights**
- Used **SQL queries as the data source** for visualization

## Data Validation & Accuracy
- Verified query outputs and metric calculations before reporting
- Ensured **data accuracy and consistency** across joins, aggregations, and KPIs

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
- Relational Database Design
- Power BI
